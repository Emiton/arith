Design Document for Arith
by Cameron LaFreniere and Emiton Alves

What should the design document do?

Part 1:
-Describe our overall design
 - Include Separate descriptions of each component
 - Components with most of design done for us (need detailed test plan for each of these):
  - Bitpack
  - image part 1
  - image part 2
  - image part n
 - Explain how all image components will be implemented together
 - Create separate designs for each component image 

Part 2:
- Create overall architecture (ask daniels)
- Create an architecture of each major component
 - includes identification of modules, type, and functions by name
 - sketch types' definitions and functions' specifications in concise, informal English
 - essentially (what will each function do?)

Part 3:
- unit testing for each component (testing in isolation) 
- write down "universal laws" that your program must follow
 - make sure they work for a variety of inputs
